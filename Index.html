  <div class="card">Non-vegetarian</div>
  	<p>Non-vegetarian (non-veg) is an Indian English word that is used to refer to meaty food and also to a person who is a meatarian not a vegetarian i.e. someone who consumes meat, especially as a major source of protein.[1][2] Although the intended meaning is readily understood, these terms are not common parlance in the Anglosphere (English-speaking countries) where meat consumption is the norm, vegetarianism is a rarity, and veganism is a novelty.</p>

Dietary vegans (also known as "strict vegetarians") refrain from consuming meat, eggs, dairy products, and any other animal-derived substances.</p>
